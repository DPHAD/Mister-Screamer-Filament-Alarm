# Mister-Screamer-Filament-Alarm
A device that passively monitors the presence of 3D printer filament as a 3D printer prints.  It notifies a nearby operator with a piercing alarm when filament runs out.  The idea is to give the nearby operator a chance to feed a new spool right behind the previous one so that printing can continue uninterrupted.
