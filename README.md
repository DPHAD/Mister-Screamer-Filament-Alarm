# Mister-Screamer-Filament-Alarm
A device that passively monitors the presence of 3D printer filament as a 3D printer prints.  It notifies a nearby operator with a piercing alarm when filament runs out.  The idea is to give the nearby operator a chance to feed a new spool right behind the previous one so that printing can continue uninterrupted.

The design consists of a piece of hardware that is sensitive to orientation. When hanging vertical, it is unpowered and silent. When it is laying flat, the alarm goes off.

To do the job of filament monitoring, it dangles (rather like a keychain) from the filament line being fed into a 3D printer's extruder. When the spool runs out, the device falls to the tabletop and begins a piercing audio alarm.

This design may not be suitable for every 3D printer out there, since they come in so many shapes and sizes and filament orientations, etc. Your printer may not be able to use this device without the device getting in the way of something. It works great for me, but your results may vary.
